mail notifications from.

#### Content type mail settings
This feature enhances the notification by mail by allowing
customized email notifications for different content types.
Previously, all content types used a common email template 
for notifications.
With this enhancement, administrators can define specific email 
subjects and bodies for each content type.
###### Key Components :
 1. Content Type Configuration Interface :
    * This interface allows administrators to specify custom email subjects
      and bodies for individual content types.
2. Email Notification Trigger :
    * Whenever new content is added or updated, if custom
      email notification settings are configured for the respective
      content type.

##### Example :
Suppose you have two content types: "News" and "Events."
- For "News," you configure email notifications with the subject
  "New News Article Published!" and a body containing the article
  title and summary.
- For "Events," you configure email notifications with the subject
  "New Event Added!" and a body containing event details and date.

When new content of each type is added, the respective email
notification settings are utilized to send customized emails to subscribers.
